# ZPSMapRepo
This repo includes all of the map source files, materials, and .bsps for every single ZPS map I have ever worked on. Specifically, for the legendary Lake, Church, and Cabin maps that were (and still are to this day) popular in the game ZPS. In total, there are 23 maps included in this release and all of them have been updated for ZPS 3.1.

After many years of maintaining these maps, I have finally decided to make them all open source to be freely distributed, used, worked on, and whatever else. The map files are now available, freely, for anyone to use under GPLv3 license (see the license provided with the repo). For maps such as these, this is the way it should be. Also, for convenience purposes, I have included screenshots of the maps as well as the models, sounds, and textures used in them so that its easier to generate the maps with all of their assets.

If you do happen to port/update the maps, all I ask is that you credit the authors, keep the historic images and such in them (please, do not "rebrand" them and remove old logos and such), and release the map files openly as they were released to you.

The following things are included in this repo:

- Lake, Church, and Cabin .vmf files
- Custom models.
- Custom sound files.
- Custom textures files.
- Custom map .txt files (only used by lake_of_silence for map intro).
- Screenshots of each map (found in the Misc directory along with the custom files)

For more information about the maps, their authors, their history, download links, and other things, please see this comprehensive wiki here: https://github.com/Silenci0/ZPSMapRepo/wiki
